Week 6: python-api-challenge Data Analysis

For Part 1, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

1. According to the Latitude vs Temperature graph, we can see that cities with a latitude close to 0 have the highest temperature.
As the latitude increases or decreases, the temperature drops. 
This makes sense because countries directly on the equator experience direct overhead sun everyday.

2. According to the Latitude vs Wind Speed graph, we can see that the data is widely spread across the Latitude.
We can say that most cities, generally do not experience strong winds with only a few cities, experiencing wind speeds of more than 10 m/s.

3. According to the Latitude vs Cloudiness graph, we can see that the data is greatly wide spread across the Latitude.
We can say that there is no true correlation between cloudiness and city location.
